# StateScaleSurveyTool
Rmarkdown code to create an example automated word report (and graphs) from example state scale survey CDF and categorical condition population estimates.  The Rmarkdown document is meant to be modified and talored for your specific needs; you would customize based on your population estimates (usually generated with the R package spsurvey).
